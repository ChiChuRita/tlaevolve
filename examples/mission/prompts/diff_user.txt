# Task
Make minimal, property-preserving PlusCal/TLA+ edits that raise the FITNESS SCORE to 1.0 by ensuring TLC reports "No error has been found".

# Notes
- Follow all constraints and PlusCal reminders in `system_message.txt` (do not repeat them here).
- Focus order: (1) fix translation issues first; (2) then satisfy invariants/properties; (3) keep edits minimal/localized.
