# Task
Make minimal, property-preserving PlusCal/TLA+ edits that raise the FITNESS SCORE to 1.0 by ensuring TLC reports "No error has been found".

# Constraints
- Do NOT change module header, EXTENDS, CONSTANT(S), `Init`, `Next`, `Spec`, fairness or any property/invariant names or definitions used by the `.cfg`.
- Do NOT rename identifiers referenced by properties or the model config.
- Preserve existing indentation, labels, and whitespace.

# Strategy
1) If PlusCal→TLA translation failed, fix syntax/structure first (variables block, labels, braces, semicolons, process headers, await/assert usage).
2) Otherwise, if TLC found violations/deadlock, adjust the algorithm steps to satisfy invariants/properties without weakening them.
3) Keep edits minimal and localized.

# PlusCal reminders
- Use C-style braces `{{ }}`; end each statement with `;`.
- Declare `variables` once; local variables with `variable x = Expr;`.
- Label atomic steps and after `call/return/goto`.
- Use `process P \in ProcSet` and `self` correctly.

# Provide changes in EXACT SEARCH/REPLACE diff format

<<<<<<< SEARCH
# Original code to find and replace (must match exactly)
=======
# New replacement code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Example (PlusCal):
<<<<<<< SEARCH
variables buf = << >>;
=======
variables buf = <<>>;
>>>>>>> REPLACE

You may include multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. Each SEARCH must match exactly.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT rewrite the entire program here—focus on targeted fixes.
