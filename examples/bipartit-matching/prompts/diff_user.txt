# Task
Make minimal, property-preserving PlusCal/TLA+ edits that raise the FITNESS SCORE to 1.0 by ensuring TLC reports "No error has been found".

# Constraints
- Do NOT change module header, EXTENDS, CONSTANT(S), `Init`, `Next`, `Spec`, fairness or any property/invariant names or definitions used by the `.cfg`.
- Do NOT rename identifiers referenced by properties or the model config.
- Preserve existing indentation, labels, and whitespace.

# Strategy
1) If PlusCal→TLA translation failed, fix syntax/structure first (variables block, labels, braces, semicolons, process headers, await/assert usage).
2) Otherwise, if TLC found violations/deadlock, adjust the algorithm steps to satisfy invariants/properties without weakening them.
3) Keep edits minimal and localized.

# PlusCal reminders
- Use C-style braces `{{ }}`; end each statement with `;`.
- Declare `variables` once; local variables with `variable x = Expr;`.
- Label atomic steps and after `call/return/goto`.
- Use `process P \in ProcSet` and `self` correctly.
- Do not mix dialects: if you open with `{`, do NOT use `begin/end algorithm`; close with `}` only.
- Add labels before loops/blocks in C-style; all `goto` targets must exist.
- Avoid reserved labels like `Done`; use `Finish` (or similar) instead.
- Do not write `};` after a block; close with `}` only.
- Keep TLA+ `define`/operators outside the PlusCal body; never end `define` lines with `;`.

# Tiny C-style skeleton (for structure only)
```tla
(* --algorithm Name {
variables x = 0;
{
  L0:
    while (TRUE) {
      L1: skip;
    };
};
} *)
```
